- Strudel already support some midi functionality. I want to check how to support midi clock.
- Midi Clock sends 24 MIDI clocks per quarter note
- We will use [WebMIDI sendClock function](https://webmidijs.org/api/classes/Output/#sendClock)
- After trying to make it work for a bit, I open an issue in Strudel's github: [Support MIDI Clock · Issue #709 · tidalcycles/strudel · GitHub](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/issues/709)
	- The issue was solved in less than a day!
		- [add midi clock support by felixroos · Pull Request #710 · tidalcycles/strudel · GitHub](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/pull/710)
