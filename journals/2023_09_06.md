- Today I'm trying to improve the aspect my exported notes. Later, I'll work a bit on [[Midi and Strudel]].
- I installed [a plugin](https://github.com/sawhney17/logseq-schrodinger) to export to a Hugo blog.
	- And I think I need to install Hugo before checking how it works...
	- I try to install this [logseq hugo template](https://github.com/CharlesChiuGit/Logseq-Hugo-Template).

		- Next I could try:
			- Install it at gh-pages branch, removing README.md file from parent directory.
			- Oficial install instructions
