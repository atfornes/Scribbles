- Today I'm trying to improve the aspect my exported notes. Later, I'll work a bit on [[Midi and Strudel]].
- I installed [a plugin](https://github.com/sawhney17/logseq-schrodinger) to export to a Hugo blog.
	- And I think I need to install Hugo before checking how it works...
	- FAILED: I try to install this [logseq hugo template](https://github.com/CharlesChiuGit/Logseq-Hugo-Template).
		- I try installing it as a submodule of this repo. Instead of the more cumbersome process explained at their README.
			- ``` bash
			  git submodule add https://github.com/CharlesChiuGit/Logseq-Hugo-Template.git
			  ```
			- Well, this gives error because README.md already exist in both repos, so going back
			- ``` bash
			  git rm -rf Logseq-Hugo-Template
			  ```
