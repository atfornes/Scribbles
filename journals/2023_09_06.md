- Today I'm trying to improve the aspect my exported notes. Later, I'll work a bit on [[Midi and Strudel]].
- I installed [a plugin](https://github.com/sawhney17/logseq-schrodinger) to export to a Hugo blog.
	- And I think I need to install Hugo before checking how it works...

	- I try to install this [logseq hugo template](https://github.com/CharlesChiuGit/Logseq-Hugo-Template).

	- Next I could try:
		- Install the Hugo template at another branch, and use github pages and github actions to maintain it.
		- Follow oficial template installation instructions.
