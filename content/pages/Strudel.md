[Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/) is a [live coding]({{< ref "/pages/live coding" >}}) environment you can access from your browser.
It is easy to learn online from its [tutorial](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/workshop/getting-started).
You can use standard Javascript in [Strudel]({{< ref "/pages/Strudel" >}})! which enables exciting things such as [using the mouse position to control parameters]({{< ref "/pages/How to use cursor position in Strudel" >}}). But you have to be careful, and use single quote strings (See [here](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/learn/code#strings) why).
